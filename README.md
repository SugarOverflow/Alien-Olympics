Alien Olympics game!

The game was a physical challenge of olympics. After most of our sensors broke in playtesting we were left with only three: the bucket with the photoresistor inside to play TOSS challenges, the helmet with the accelerometer to play TILT challenges, and the pad with the piezo element to play HOP challenges.

The game was created using these various sensors, soldered and hooked up to a board with the Arduino Uno. The game was interfaced using ProcessingJS.
